            <a href="https://tankurt89.github.io/meet/"  class="navigation-list" target="_blank">Meet App Site</a>
            <p>
                Developed an app, which works both online and offline, that access a Google Calendar API to show all the events listed in specific cities. This app has access to the API using OAuth2, and features serverless functions (AWS Lambda). 
                <br>
                App is compatible with common web browsers, all screen sizes, and will also allow you to download and set it on your homepage. 
                <br>
                The code also features Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and End-to-End testing which allowed me to make sure everything that was being implemented was functioning as intended.  
                <br>
                There are also graphs that display how many events, out of how many you would like displayed, are in the city or cities that you are looking at as well as a graph that shows what the event types are. 
                <br>
                This project provided a few different difficulties that allowed for really good debugging, and growth as a coder overall. The most difficult of which was getting the OAuth to function properly but now that it is, I have a good template for how to implement it in the future.
