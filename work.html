            <p>
                Chatting was a mobile app created using React Native. It allows the user to send messages, images, and their current location to one another. The users can also take photos, and record audio to send to one another as well. Information is stored on Firebase for this app.

            <p>
                This project was a frontend client built using Angular that was integrated with the myFlix API that was built previously. The user is allowed to either signup for a new account, or login using existing information. Once logged in the user will have access to all the movies stored in the database and also information related to the movie. That additional information includes Director information, Genre information, and a synopsis on the movie. 
                <br>
                The user may also add or remove the movie from their favorite list. They may also view their personal profile where they can delete their account, make any changes to their account, or remove movies from their favorite list.

            <h2>Meet App</h2>
            <a href="https://tankurt89.github.io/meet/"  class="navigation-list" target="_blank">Meet App Site</a>
            <p>
                Developed an app, which works both online and offline, that access a Google Calendar API to show all the events listed in specific cities. This app has access to the API using OAuth2, and features serverless functions (AWS Lambda). 
                <br>
                App is compatible with common web browsers, all screen sizes, and will also allow you to download and set it on your homepage. 
                <br>
                The code also features Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and End-to-End testing which allowed me to make sure everything that was being implemented was functioning as intended.  
                <br>
                There are also graphs that display how many events, out of how many you would like displayed, are in the city or cities that you are looking at as well as a graph that shows what the event types are. 
                <br>
                This project provided a few different difficulties that allowed for really good debugging, and growth as a coder overall. The most difficult of which was getting the OAuth to function properly but now that it is, I have a good template for how to implement it in the future.

                This version of the myFlix client was built using React and is hosted on Netlify. The user is allowed to either signup or login using an existing account.

            <p>
                This was my first ever project. It is an API integrated Pokédex. It was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to help me understand the basics of programming. When the site is loaded it gives a list of the original 151 Pokémon, that the visitor can click on. When the user clicks on the name of the Pokémon that would like info on a module opens up showing the user a picture of the Pokémon and their height. It also has a search functionality to help you find the Pokémon you are looking for.
